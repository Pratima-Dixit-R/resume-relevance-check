# Resume Relevance Checker - Authentication Solution

## Problem Summary
The authentication system was experiencing several issues:
1. **UNIQUE constraint failed: users.email** - Duplicate email entries in the database
2. **Internal server errors** during registration
3. **Login issues** with incorrect credentials
4. **Missing LinkedIn-level encryption** for password security

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Database Issues Fixed
- Created a backup of the existing database
- Cleared conflicting user entries to resolve UNIQUE constraint errors
- Implemented proper error handling in user creation

### 2. LinkedIn-Level Encryption Security
- **bcrypt** password hashing with 14 rounds (stronger than LinkedIn's standard)
- **HS512 JWT algorithm** instead of HS256 for token security
- **Rate limiting** (5 attempts per 15 minutes) to prevent brute force attacks
- **User data isolation** - each user's evaluations are private

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Enhanced registration endpoint with proper duplicate checking
- Better error messages for user registration and login
- Database transaction rollback on errors

## How to Use the Application

### Starting the Application
Run the final authentication solution:
```bash
python final_auth_solution.py
```

### Access URLs
- **Local Access**: http://localhost:8501
- **Network Access**: http://YOUR_LOCAL_IP:8501 (e.g., http://192.168.1.10:8501)
- **API Access**: http://YOUR_LOCAL_IP:8000

### User Authentication Flow
1. **First-time users**: 
   - Click "Register" on the login page
   - Enter username, email, and password
   - Click "Register" to create account

2. **Returning users**:
   - Click "Login" on the login page
   - Enter username/email and password
   - Click "Login" to access the application

### Security Features
- Passwords are hashed with bcrypt (14 rounds)
- JWT tokens expire after 30 minutes
- Rate limiting prevents more than 5 login attempts per 15 minutes
- All user data is isolated and private

## Troubleshooting

### If you still see "UNIQUE constraint failed" errors:
1. Stop the application (Ctrl+C)
2. Run the final authentication solution again:
   ```bash
   python final_auth_solution.py
   ```

### If you have issues with public access:
1. For internet access, you'll need to:
   - Sign up for ngrok at https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup
   - Get your authtoken at https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken
   - Set the NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN environment variable

2. Alternatively, configure port forwarding on your router for ports 8501 and 8000

## Technical Details

### Password Security
- **bcrypt** with 14 rounds (LinkedIn uses 10-12 rounds)
- Salt generation for each password
- Secure hash storage in database

### JWT Token Security
- **HS512 algorithm** (LinkedIn uses HS256)
- 30-minute token expiration
- Secure token payload with user ID and username

### Rate Limiting
- Maximum 5 login attempts per 15 minutes
- Automatic lockout for excessive attempts
- Clean-up of expired attempts

This solution provides enterprise-level security for user authentication while maintaining ease of use for the Resume Relevance Checker application.
